Directions for publishing: https://pages.github.com/

A push to main should be sufficient for publication.

I switched the branch in Settings->Pages and that worked on May 11 2023

# Organization Notes

I know this is not the best looking website, including some high level descriptions as a note-to-self.


## css

My CSS skills are rudimentary but I have tried to apply a uniform style. 
Information in mystyles.css.

Note there is a mobile mode and a non-mobile mode. There is some kind of screen size 
cutoff for the two modes. There should be comments describing which style corresponds to 
which mode in the mystyles.css file.

## js

The javascript file static.js takes care of the navbar and the footer. Footer should be 
altered after each edit to reflect last edited date. 

## Pages

Each page has several components:

- Copied junk (imports, etc.)

- Load navbar

- Entries: So this would ideally be in a database but right now all entries are embedded.
There are several layers to most entries, a description component and an image/video component. Eventually would want to change this but ok for now. 


- footer.
