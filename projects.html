                        <h2> Cadenza for Max  </h2>
                            <par> Currently developing a MaxMSP external of the Informatics Philharmonic application. This external will allow users to input a single-line music score. Then, when a user plays the piece, the external will output real-time predictions of when they will place future notes. This will allow for a range of applications including real-time generation of music videos, automatic stage performance light control, and improved score-based synchronization of new music compositions. Previously demonstrated proof-of-concept by modifiying the Informatics Philharmonic to send note predictions as UDP signals to a Max Patch. See video of SEAMUS Conference 2021 presentation (top) for a demonstration of the UDP-based prototype, and a sample composition by Kaitlin Pet demonstrating the close synchronization allowed by this software. </par>

                        <h2> Virtual Ensemble Assembly  </h2>
                            <par> Remotely assembled music today depends on a pre-determined ``reference track". While reference tracks ensure all parts sound `in sync' when combined, they restrict a musician's ability  to pick their own tempo or perform other timing-related musical gestures. Working with expert ensembles, we present experiments that address this problem. We first created a remote assembly pipeline allowing artists to have temporal freedom  during the recording process. We then develop three algorithms that preserved players' original timing intentions while ensuring relative synchrony between parts: 1) direct modeling of chamber music expertise, 2) optimization of desirable performance qualities, and 3) performance simulation based on competing goals.  Though the resulting music we assembled did not capture the full expressive range of an in-person performance, our work both increases the quality and ease of making remote recording and introduces exciting new applications for aiding synchronous rehearsal and performance.  </par>

                        <par> A network-based music visualization tool developed in D3 Observable, "NCBot" has been used for interactive visualizations and music videos. See <a href = "https://observablehq.com/@kpet123/music-network-zfest-demo">demo on Observable server</a> </par>.

                        <par> The videos on the right, produced in conjunction with Nikki Pet, use this type of network animations- in this case generated to match pre-recorded music. I first used a score-follower to find note onset times in the recordings, then those note onset times were mapped to network animation.  </par>

              <h2> "Flexible Media" Adaptations  </h2>
                  <par> I worked with composer JacobTV and saxophonist Connie Frigo to adapt three of his pieces, Billie, Garden of Love, and Farewell Feathered Frieds, for flexible media using the Informatics Philharmonic software. I coined "Flexible media" as fixed media piece outfitted with score prediction software so it can speed up and slow down to match the tempo of a live player. Through this process, we explored the benefits and drawbacks of this new medium of performance. </par>
                  
                  <br>
                  <par>The top video shows Jamey Guzeman performing JacobTV's Farewell Feathered Friends with our flexible system. The bottom video is a recording of a presentation at the North American Saxophone Allience 2019 conference, where saxophonist Connie Frigo presented and performed a flexible verison of Billie.</par>
